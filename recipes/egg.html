        <p>Melt butter in an 8-inch nonstick skillet or seasoned cast iron skillet over medium heat. Crack the egg into the skillet and cook undisturbed until the egg white is firm and set, but the yolk is still runny and intact, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.</p>

        <p>Transfer the egg to a plate, season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.</p>
